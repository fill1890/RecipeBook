Recipe
------

**Popcorn**

1. Heat ~1tbsp ghee (or oil) in large pot over medium heat
#. Add 3/4 cups popcorn, shake to spread evenly, lid and clamp down
#. Shake gently once shortly after popping begins
#. Remove from heat when popped and transfer to bowl
#. (Optional) Remove and discard unpopped kernels

**Caramel**

*Preheat oven to 110ÂºC*

1. Melt 100g butter in saucepan over medium heat
#. While melting, prepare 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup stabiliser, 1/2 tsp salt
#. Add sugar, stabiliser and salt; stir until just combined
#. Wait for bubbling to begin; prepare 4 minute timer
#. Once bubbling, simmer for 4 minutes WITHOUT stirring
#. While simmering, prepare 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking soda
#. Remove from heat, whisk in vanilla and baking soda
#. Pour caramel over popcorn, toss with spatula until beginning to cool

**Baking**

1. Transfer popcorn to two baking trays; evenly spread
2. Bake. At 10 minute intervals, remove from oven and toss with spatula to
   more evenly coat caramel with popcorn
3. Bake until popcorn is light and crispy; minimum 45 minutes, longer with glucose
   or honey

Notes
-----

1. Vary depending on desired coverage. 3/4 cup gives decent coverage without
   being over-sweet; 1/3 cup gives candy-like pieces.
2. Used to stabilise caramel to prevent sugar crystallisation. Glucose and honey
   will require extra baking time
3. Baking soda foams up caramel and makes coating popcorn easier
4. Baking the coated popcorn allows a more even coat of caramel, and dries
   out the popcorn for crispness and longer storage times
5. Cleaning is much easier with heat. Use hot tap water or boiling water on
   utensils coated with caramel
