===============

Ingredients
-----------

- Corn kernels; 3/4 cup air popping, 1 cup pot (Note 1)
- Dash of ghee, for popping. Alternatives: Vegetable oil
- Unsalted butter, 100g
- Brown sugar, 200g (1 cup packed)
- Caramel stabiliser, 80g (1/2 cup). One of (Note 2):

  - Corn syrup (neutral)
  - Glucose (neutral)
  - Honey
  - Treacle
  - Golden syrup

- Cooking salt, 1/2 tsp
- Vanilla extract, 1 tsp
- Baking soda (bicarb), 1/2 tsp

Utensils
--------

- Large pot with good lid, for popping corn OR air popper
- Small saucepan, for making caramel
- Two spatulas, for scraping/tossing
- Two baking trays
- Whisk
- Cup measures: 1, 3/4, 1/2
- (Optional) Teaspoon measures

Recipe
------

**Popcorn (Pot)**

1. Heat ~1tbsp ghee (or oil) in large pot over medium heat
#. Add 3/4 cups popcorn, shake to spread evenly, lid and clamp down
#. Shake gently once shortly after popping begins
#. Remove from heat when popped and transfer to bowl
#. (Optional) Remove and discard unpopped kernels

**Popcorn (Air)**

1. Preheat popper for about a minute
#. Dispense a measuring cup of kernels into the popper
#. Run until popper empty
#. Transfer popped corn into a baking tray
#. Recycle kernels and fragments into popper, topping up with fresh kernels
#. Run the popper for a second to plit out fragements and discard
#. Repeat from 3 until all corn used

Some kernels may not pop and end up burnt. Discard these.

**Caramel**

*Preheat oven to 110ÂºC*

1. Melt 100g butter in microwave
#. While melting, into small saucepan put 220g brown sugar, 80g stabiliser, and
   1/2 tsp salt
#. Once butter melted, pour into saucepan and place over medium heat
#. Stir ingredients until just combined
#. Wait for bubbling to begin; prepare 4 minute timer
#. Once bubbling, simmer for 4 minutes WITHOUT stirring. Caramel will start to
   burn easily after 4 minutes, so don't linger
#. While simmering, prepare 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking soda
#. Remove from heat, whisk in vanilla and baking soda
#. Pour caramel over popcorn in trays, toss with spatula until beginning to cool

**Baking**

1. Transfer popcorn to two baking trays; evenly spread
2. Bake. At 10 minute intervals, remove from oven and toss with spatula to
   more evenly coat caramel with popcorn
3. Bake until popcorn is light and crispy; minimum 45 minutes, longer with glucose
   or honey. Taste testing is best

Notes
-----

1. Vary depending on desired coverage. 3/4 cup gives decent coverage without
   being over-sweet; 1/3 cup gives candy-like pieces. Air popping (with
   recycling kernels) gives more yield - only need 3/4 cup.
2. Used to stabilise caramel to prevent sugar crystallisation. Glucose and honey
   will require extra baking time
3. Baking soda foams up caramel and makes coating popcorn easier
4. Baking the coated popcorn allows a more even coat of caramel, and dries
   out the popcorn for crispness and longer storage times
5. Cleaning is much easier with heat. Use hot tap water or boiling water on
   utensils coated with caramel
